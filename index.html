Alternate modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release. The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new colors for weapons.</li><br>
    <li><a style="color:rgb(206, 103, 34);font-weight: bold" href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant : </a><br>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.</li><br>

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.</li><br>
    <li><a style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-weight: bold" href="https://www.callofduty.com/content/atvi/callofduty/warzone/web/en/home.html">Call of Duty Warzone : </a><br>The Call of Duty Modern Warfare's main campaign centers around a battle against a terrorist organization Al-Qatala.

    <li><a style="color:rgb(238, 56, 11);font-weight: bold" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/hyper-scape">Hyperscape : </a><br>The game's main mode shares elements with other battle royale games, where up to 100 players are dropped on to a map that slowly shrinks over time with players seeking to eliminate the competition. One main difference between Hyper Scape and other popular battle royale games is that in Hyper Scape, insteading of a circle shrinking as the game progresses, random sectors of the map disappear. The game however differs in that once the last sector closes, a crown appears, any player that is able to hold on to the crown for 60 seconds is automatically declared the winner. Alternatively, the game also ends when only one player or team remains. Throughout the game, players can find both weapons as well as special abilities known as "Hacks," such as letting the player transform into a giant ball from which they can bounce around, or letting them become invisible. Players can only have two weapons and hacks available at a time, although each item can be swapped out during a round.</li><br>
